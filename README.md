## How Much Caffeine 
### App Summary 
- How much caffeine will calculate how much caffeine user already had and give the user advice [Healthy amount of caffeine](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much/ "FDA").
### App Logic
- App will take the amount of drink or food, convert it into metric unit(back end #1), then use the converted amount to calculate the amount of caffeine(back end #2).Finally, return the amount in the front end.

### Stretch Goals
- Combine the time when user using the app and the amount of caffeine to give advice.
